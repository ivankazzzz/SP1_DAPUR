var ele1History="Henry là người đầu tiên phân biệt được Hiđro từ các khí khác; trong năm 1766, ông đã điều chế nó bằng phản ứng giữa axit clohiđric với kẽm.<br><br>Năm 1670, nhà khoa học Anh Robert Boyle đã quan sát và thấy hiđro tạo ra mạnh mẽ từ phản ưng axit với kim loại.<br><br>Nhà hóa học Pháp Antonie Lavoisier sau này đặt tên nguyên tố hiđro vào năm 1873."
var ele2History="French astronomer Jules Janssen obtained the first evidence of helium during the solar eclipse of 1868.<br><br>Norman Lockyer and Edward Frankland suggested the name helium for the new element.<br><br>In 1895, Sir William Ramsay discovered helium in the uranium mineral cleveite.<br><br>It was independently discovered in cleveite by Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet."
var ele3History="Lithium was discovered by Johann Arfvedson in 1817 when he was analyzing minerals from the island of Uto in Sweden.<br><br>The pure metal was isolated the following year by both Swedish chemist William Thomas Brande and English chemist Sir Humphry Davy working independently.<br><br>In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen."
var ele4History="Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin discovered beryllium in the oxide form in both beryl and emeralds in 1798.<br><br>Friedrich Wöhler and Antoine Bussy independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by the chemical reaction of metallic potassium with beryllium chloride.<br><br>The first commercially-successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1932 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt."
var ele5History="Boron compounds have been known for thousands of years, but the element was not discovered until 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy and by Gay-Lussac and Thenard.<br><br>Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard.<br><br>Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824."
var ele6History="‎Cacbon được phát hiện ở thời tiền sử và được biết đến trong các dạng thù hình như bồ hóng và than trong các nền văn minh cổ xưa nhất của loài người.<br><br>Năm 1772, Antonie Lavoisier đã cho thấy rằng kim cương là một dạng thù hình của Cacbon; khi ông đốt cháy mẫu than và kim cương và thấy rằng nó không tạo ra nước.<br><br>Năm 1779, Carl Wilhelm Scheele cho thấy than chì bị đốt cháy tạo thành điôxít cacbon và do đó phải là một dạng thù hình của cacbon."
var ele7History="Nitrogen is considered to have been discovered by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it noxious air or fixed air.<br><br>It was also studied at about the same time by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley.<br><br>In 1790 the French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal named the element nitrogen."
